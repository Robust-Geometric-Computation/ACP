exp6.tgz contains the full source for experiment 6, so it has copies of these files.

make randomtest
./randomtest

Edit the top of angle.h to select the identity detection method.  Right now it is set to perturbation (homotopy):

//#define TABLE_IDENTITY
//#define GCD_IDENTITY
//#define RESIDUE_IDENTITY1
//#define RESIDUE_IDENTITY2
#define HOMOTOPY_IDENTITY

Note that the folder has the two txt files containing the tables.

HOMOTOPY_IDENTITY: n = 1 homotopy
no defines: n = 2 homotopy
residue1: n = 1 residue
residue2: m = 2 residue
